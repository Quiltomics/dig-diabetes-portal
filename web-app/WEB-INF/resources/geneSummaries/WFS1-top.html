    WFS1 encodes the transmembrane protein wolframin, which regulates calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum
    and plays a role in the ER\'s unfolded protein response.
    A <a href="http://www.jci.org/articles/view/39678">2010 study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation</a>
    found that the gene suppresses ER stress signaling by upregulating a key transcription factor (ATF6α)
    and downregulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1. Pancreatic β cells without functioning copies of WFS1
    exhibit dysregulated ER stress signaling, eventually leading to cell death.

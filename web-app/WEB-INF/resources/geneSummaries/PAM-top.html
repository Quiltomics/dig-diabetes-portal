    <em>PAM</em> plays a key role in the synthesis of neuroendocrine peptide hormones with C-terminal alpha-amide function,
    including proinsulin. The gene encodes a secretory granule membrane enzyme with two catalytically active
    domains that work together to sequentially alpha-amidate the peptides, the final step in their synthesis.
    Without this step, the peptides cannot be fully biologically active.

    <em>HNF1A</em> encodes a transcription factor that is highly expressed in the human liver, where it regulates several genes.
    A low-frequency variant in <em>HNF1A</em> -- found in some 2 percent of individuals of Mexican or Latino ancestry --
    raises risk of type 2 diabetes by fivefold, the largest effect ever observed for a T2D variant found in
    more than 0.1 percent of the population.
    The same variant has been reported as a cause of the rare Mendelian form of diabetes known as MODY.

    <em>SLC30A8</em> encodes the zinc transporter ZnT8 and is expressed almost exclusively in pancreatic islets.
    ZnT8 carries zinc ions from the cytoplasm of Î² cells into insulin granules.
    The zinc is then secreted along with insulin and acts as an <a href="http://www.jci.org/articles/view/68807">"endogenous molecular switch"</a>
    that slows hepatic insulin clearance in response to food intake.
    A common missense variant in <em>SLC30A8</em> raises type 2 diabetes risk;
    however, rare loss-of function variants in the gene <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v46/n4/full/ng.2915.html">protect against the disease</a>.
    Inhibiting ZnT8 might therefore treat or prevent type 2 diabetes.

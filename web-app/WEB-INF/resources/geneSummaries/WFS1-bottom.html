    Prior to the advent of large-scale genetic studies of complex traits,
    <em>WFS1</em> was <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v20/n2/full/ng1098_143.html">primarily implicated in Wolfram syndrome</a>,
    a rare recessive disorder caused by any of some 200 mutations in the gene, including indels and missense variants.
    (A milder form of the disease, Wolfram-like syndrome, is caused by different mutations in WFS1.)
    Patients with Wolfram syndrome typically develop type 2 diabetes after the endoplasmic reticulum in β cells fails.

    In 2007, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672152/">a study of 1,536 SNPs in 84 genes</a>
    regulating β cell development, growth, function and survival found that several SNPs in or near
    <em>WFS1</em> were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in populations of European ancestry.
    (All SNPs were in LD with the intronic SNP rs10010131, the strongest hit.)
    The following year, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/gene210/files/readings/clinical-genetic-t2dm-nejm.pdf">a genotyping study</a>
    of 16 SNPs in 16,061 Swedish and 2,770 Finnish research participants also found
    an association between type 2 diabetes and rs10010131 (OR = 1.12; P = 0.001).

<p>
    Subsequent genome-wide association studies of type 2 diabetes have implicated two other variants in <em>WFS1</em>:
    <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v41/n10/full/ng.443.html">rs4689388</a> (OR = 1.16, P = 1x10_8) and
    <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v42/n7/full/ng.609.html">rs1801214</a> (OR = 1.13, P = 3x10-8).
    Both variants reach genome-wide significance in exome chip data included in this portal.

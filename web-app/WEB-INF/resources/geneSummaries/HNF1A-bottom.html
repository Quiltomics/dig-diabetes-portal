    In 2014, a whole-exome sequencing study of 3,756 Mexican and Latino samples (1,794 T2D cases and 1,962 controls) --
    collected and analyzed by SIGMA researchers --
    found a low-frequency missense variant (p.E508K) in <em>HNF1A</em> with a very strong effect on T2D risk (OR=5.48, P=4.4x10-7).
    Independent replication studies found a similarly strong effect (combined 1,443 T2D cases and 1,673 controls, OR=4.16, P=0.0013).
    The variant, which appeared in 2.1% of T2D cases compared to 0.36% of controls in the SIGMA study,
    has not been observed in any non-Latino or non-Hispanic population,
    despite the fact that large candidate gene studies of <em>HNF1A</em> have been conducted in such populations (e.g., European and East Asian).
    In a SIGMA analysis of a combined 25,663 exomes,
    the p.E508K variant was identified only in Mexican individuals and Latinos from the southern United States,
    suggesting that the variant may be specific to those populations.

    Variants in <em>HNF1A</em> have been reported to influence protein function and MODY risk by disrupting protein localization,
    weakening the protein's ability to bind to DNA, and reducing the effects of gene transcription (transactivation).
    Experimental work conducted by SIGMA researchers showed that the p.E508K variant reduces transactivation.

    Prior to the 2014 SIGMA study, the p.E508K variant was reported as a rare cause of Mendelian mature onset diabetes of the young (MODY) --
    a condition that is in and of itself rare, manifests at earlier ages (<20 years) than T2D on average,
    and may present in non-obese patients.
    However, in the SIGMA study, T2D patients who carried the p.E508K variant were indistinguishable from those who did not:
    there were no significant differences in age of onset, weight, waist circumference or glucose levels.
    Future clinical trials will seek to determine whether T2D patients who carry the p.E508K variant respond better to sulfonylureas --
    a relatively inexpensive type drug often used to treat MODY -- than they do to other common T2D treatments such as metformin.

    <em>SLC16A11</em> is a member of the monocarboxylic acid transporter family of solute carriers. The gene is expressed in the human liver, and the encoded protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. In 2013, a genome-wide association study conducted by SIGMA found a haplotype, present in half of samples from people of Native American ancestry, that changes four amino acids in SLC16A11 and is significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (P = 3.9 x 10-13; OR = 1.29). Subsequent experimental work suggested a role for SLC16A11 in triglyceride metabolism in the liver. (Serum levels of triglycerides have been reported as associated withs T2D.)

    A missense variant in PAM, rs35658696 (encoding p.Asp563Gly) was reported to be associated with
    insulin secretion as measured by the insulinogenic index
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3727235/">in a 2013 exome chip study</a>
    of 8,229 non-diabetic Finnish males (P=1.9×10−8).
    The authors noted that "the reference aspartic acid is well conserved across vertebrates and
    located in one of the catalytic domains, and the glycine substitution is predicted to be damaging.”

    rs35658696, as well as another missense variant in PAM (rs78408340, encoding p.Ser539Trp),
    was also reported to moderately increase risk of type 2 diabetes in
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464100">a 2014 study</a>
    that combined whole-genome sequencing and imputation in 280,884 Icelandic cases and controls,
    with replication in Danish and Iranian samples.

<p>
    This portal contains data on both variants,
    including an exome chip analysis in which <a href="http://type2diabetesgenetics.org/variant/variantInfo/rs35658696">rs35658696</a>
    is associated with type 2 diabetes above genome-wide significance.

    Mouse research further suggests a role for PAM in glucose regulation.
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16225857">Mice heterozygous for a null mutation in PAM</a> develop normally,
    but by 10 months show mild glucose intolerance and increased adiposity compared to littermate controls.

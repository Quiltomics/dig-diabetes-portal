    <em>C19orf80</em>, alias <em>ANGPTL8</em>, encodes a hormone called betatrophin (also called lipasin).
    In 2013, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23623304">betatrophin was reported</a>
    to dramatically promote pancreatic β cell proliferation, expand β cell mass,
    and improve glucose tolerance in mice. Its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated;
    according to the 2013 paper, the hormone does not appear to contribute to insulin resistance,
    a known cause of β cell proliferation. Variants in C19orf80 have also been repeatedly linked with several
    lipid traits in mouse and human studies.

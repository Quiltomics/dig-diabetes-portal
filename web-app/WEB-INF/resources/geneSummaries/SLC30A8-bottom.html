    <em>SLC30A8</em> <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7130/full/nature05616.html">was first implicated as a diabetes-related gene in 2007</a>,
    when the common missense variant rs13266634 was found to raise type 2 diabetes risk (P = 1x10_8; OR = 1.18).
    Soon after, four other genome-wide association studies replicated the association at nominal significance;
    since then the SNP has been implicated in other European and East Asian populations
    (though findings are less clear in populations of African ancestry, in which the variant is less common).
    A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22885922">DIAGRAM Consortium study</a> with 35,000 cases and 115,000 controls,
    all of European ancestry, found a strong association for the SNP (P = 1.3 x 10-21) and an odds raio of 1.13 --
    the fourth highest among the 63 reported T2D-associated SNPs at that time.
    (Results from DIAGRAM-3 are included in this portal.)
    A very large transethnic analysis, also from the DIAGRAM consortium, found similar effect sizes and evidence for association,
    and narrowed the list of potential causal SNPs to two (including rs13266634).

    In 2014, however, new evidence reversed the prevailing therapeutic hypothesis --
    rare loss-of function variants in <em>SLC30A8</em> were found to
    <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v46/n4/full/ng.2915.html">protect against type 2 diabetes</a>
    rather than raise risk. The findings suggested that inhibiting the ZnT8 protein might treat or prevent type 2 diabetes.
    Through sequencing or genotyping of ~150,000 research participants across five ancestry groups,
    the authors identified 12 rare protein-truncating variants in <em>SLC30A8</em> that collectively reduced T2D risk by 65%.
    Non-diabetic Icelandic carriers of one of the variants (a frameshift, p.Lys34Serfs*50) also had reduced
    glucose levels (P = 4.6 × 10−4). That variant and another (p.Arg138*) were found to encode unstable forms of ZnT8.

    <em>SLC30A8</em> has been the subject of extensive functional and mouse studies.
    Overexpression and knockdown studies of rodent beta-cell lines have both suggested that ZnT8 activity is
    positively correlated with zinc transport and insulin secretion.
    Mouse studies have been less clear-cut, with knockouts resulting in phenotypic heterogeneity --
    possibly due to small sample sizes, different environments, or variable genetic backgrounds.
    In an attempt to remove possible genetic confounders,
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22829903">one study</a> of <em>SLC30A8</em> knockout mice from the inbred strain C57BL/6J
    found that all mice had normal glucose levels and glucose-stimulated secretion
    (though islet zinc content was reduced, and females also showed lower insulin levels).
    The authors concluded that "the absence of ZnT-8 does not have a substantial impact on mouse physiology."

    In the SIGMA study, each copy of the four-variant risk haplotype was associated with a 20% increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
    The risk haplotype was more strongly associated with T2D in younger, leaner patients --
    individuals carrying the haplotype developed the disease 2.1 years earlier
    and at slightly lower BMIs than those who did not carry the haplotype.

    The risk haplotype was identified in half of Native American samples and 10 percent of East Asian samples,
    but was rare in European and African samples.
    (A variant in the nearby gene <em>SLC16A11</em>, rs312457,
    was also reported in East Asian samples to be significantly associated with T2D.)
    Analysis of a genome from a Neanderthal found in Denisova Cave in Siberia --
    conducted as part of the SIGMA study -- identified the risk haplotype in the fossil DNA,
    suggesting the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals.

hypothesisGen.geneFilters.intro=There are three ways to create a list of variants
hypothesisGen.geneFilters.by_hand.title=Enter the list by hand
hypothesisGen.geneFilters.by_hand.desc=Type (or else copy and paste) a variant list. Each variant should be in quotes and separated by commas
hypothesisGen.geneFilters.file.title=Reference an existing list in a file
hypothesisGen.geneFilters.file.desc=Choose a file containing variant. The file must contain only one variant on each line
hypothesisGen.geneFilters.database.title=Search for variants in the database using annotations

hypothesisGen.variantFilters.specify_variants=Specify particular variants
hypothesisGen.variantFilters.variant_upload.by_type=Type (or else copy and paste) a variant list. Each variant should be in quotes and separated by commas
hypothesisGen.variantFilters.variant_upload.by_file=Choose a file containing variant. The file must contain only one variant on each line

hypothesisGen.variantSearchEffectsOnProtiens.title=Display only variants with the following predicted effects on encoded proteins
hypothesisGen.variantSearchEffectsOnProtiens.desc=<p> Loss-of-function variants <a href="http://www.plengegen.com/wp-content/uploads/Plenge_NRDD_2013_geneticsTV.pdf">can be valuable models for drug development</a> because they naturally illustrate the phenotypic effects of deactivating a gene. Several types of variants may cause a loss of function; most obviously, variants that truncate a protein may prevent it from playing its normal biological role. Missense variants have a wider variety of effects on protein structure, which can be difficult to ascertain with annotation tools alone. Results obtained from such tools should therefore be treated with care. </p> <p> The tools at left take different information into account to predict the effects of SNPs on protein structure. <strong>PolyPhen-2</strong> predictions are based on whether a variant appears in a region that is highly conserved across species (and thus may serve critical biological functions), and whether the variant is in a location likely to affect the protein's 3D structure. <strong>SIFT</strong> also relies on sequence conservation across species to predict whether a protein will tolerate any given single amino acid substitution at any given position in its sequence. <strong>Condel</strong> combines the weighted averages for several such algorithms (including but not limited to PolyPhen-2 and SIFT) for a consensus prediction. </p>

hypothesisGen.variantSearchRestrictToEthnicity.title=Set allele frequencies (use only if searching exome sequence data)
hypothesisGen.variantSearchRestrictToEthnicity.desc=<p> Allele frequencies can vary widely by population, and some variants may influence disease risk in one population but not another. For instance, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24390345">a set of five variants</a> in the gene <em>SLC16A11</em> is common in people of Native American ancestry and increases T2D risk in that population; however, the variants are low-frequency or rare in other ancestry groups, and appear to play little to no role in T2D in Europeans. Thus, <em>SLC16A11</em> was not implicated in early GWAS of type 2 diabetes, which focused on people of European ancestry. </p>

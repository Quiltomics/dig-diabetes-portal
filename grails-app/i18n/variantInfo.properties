variant.impactOnProtein.variantTruncateProtein=Does this variant truncate the protein?
variant.impactOnProtein.variantTruncateProtein.helpText=<p>Protein-truncating variants prematurely halt the translation of nucleic acids, resulting \
in an abnormally short protein. If this protein cannot play its normal biological role, the \
variant is considered a "loss-of-function" (LoF) variant. Large deletions of DNA, variants \
that disrupt splice sites (thereby preventing introns from being removed from mRNA), \
and frameshifts (insertions or deletions that render mRNA unable to read codons in the \
proper sets of three) may also cause a loss of function. However, it is not always easy to \
predict the effects of variants on protein structure, and the results of algorithms that do \
so should be treated with care.</p><p> \
Specific LoF variants tend to be rare in the population at large. However, the average \
individual carries about 100 LoF variants genome-wide. Some LoF variants cause \
disease, others have no phenotypic effect, and still others are protective, such as LoF \
variants in the gene <em>SLC30A8</em> that protect against diabetes. Protective LoF variants in \
humans can serve as models for drugs intended to prevent disease by deactivating targets.</p>
variant.impactOnProtein.polyphenPrediction=PolyPhen-2</a> prediction and score:
variant.impactOnProtein.polyphenPrediction.helpText=<p class="term-description-expansion">\n \
<strong>PolyPhen-2 predicts a variant's effects on protein structure and function based on whether the variant appears in a region that is highly conserved across \
species (and thus may serve critical biological functions), and whether the variant is in a location likely to affect the protein's 3D structure.</strong> \
For comparison, this portal provides results from two other algorithms that also predict the effects of a variant on protein structure. SIFT relies on \
sequence conservation across species to predict whether a protein will tolerate any given single amino acid substitution at any given position in its sequence. \
Condel combines the weighted averages for several such algorithms (including but not limited to PolyPhen-2 and SIFT) for a consensus prediction.\

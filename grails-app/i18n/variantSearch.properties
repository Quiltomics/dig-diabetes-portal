variantSearch.setAlleleFrequencies.title=Set allele frequencies (use only if searching exome sequence data)
variantSearch.setAlleleFrequencies.sigmaHelpText=Allele frequencies are derived from both exome sequencing and exome chip datasets. \
If a variant is in exome chip, its frequency from that study is used, since the sample size of exome chip studies is much larger. \
If a variant is in exome sequencing but not exome chip (as is the case with most rare variants), its frequency from exome chip. \
You can see whether a variant is from exome sequencing or exome chip from the <em>SIGMA source</em> column in the variant table. \
Finally, note that if a variant is not seen in either exome sequencing or exome chip data, it is assigned an allele frequency of 0.0. \
There is currently no way to identify whether a variant was genotyped and not seen, or was not in a part of the genome included in these studies.
variantSearch.setAlleleFrequencies.exomeSequencingHelpText=Allele frequencies can vary widely by population, and some variants may influence disease risk in one population but not another. \
For instance, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24390345">a set of five variants</a> \
in the gene <em>SLC16A11</em> is common in people of Native American ancestry and increases T2D risk in that population; \
however, the variants are low-frequency or rare in other ancestry groups, \
and appear to play little to no role in T2D in Europeans. \
Thus, <em>SLC16A11</em> was not implicated in early GWAS of type 2 diabetes, which focused on people of European ancestry.

variantSearch.proteinEffectRestrictions.helpText=<p>\nLoss-of-function variants \
<a href="http://www.plengegen.com/wp-content/uploads/Plenge_NRDD_2013_geneticsTV.pdf">can be valuable models for drug development</a> because \
they naturally illustrate the phenotypic effects of deactivating a gene.  \
Several types of variants may cause a loss of function; \
most obviously, variants that truncate a protein may prevent it from playing its normal biological role. \
Missense variants have a wider variety of effects on protein structure, \
which can be difficult to ascertain with annotation tools alone. \
Results obtained from such tools should therefore be treated with care. \
</p>\n<p>\nThe tools at left take different information into account to predict the effects of SNPs on protein structure. \
<strong>PolyPhen-2</strong> predictions are based on whether a variant appears in a region that is highly conserved across species \
(and thus may serve critical biological functions), \
and whether the variant is in a location likely to affect the protein's 3D structure. \
<strong>SIFT</strong> also relies on sequence conservation across species to predict whether a protein will \
tolerate any given single amino acid substitution at any given position in its sequence. \
<strong>Condel</strong> combines the weighted averages for several such algorithms (including but not limited to PolyPhen-2 and SIFT) \
for a consensus prediction.\n</p>

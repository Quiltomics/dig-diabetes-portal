about.the.portal.text=This paragraph will explore the data, the purpose of the portal, and funders and contributors (with links to either their \
websites or to appropriate educational content). We'll explain that people can use the portal for target validation, translational work \
in model systems, etc. Eventually the space could be used for news updates, though I want to hold off on those for now.

about.the.portal.text=The Knowledge Portal is being developed by a team of scientists and software engineers at the Broad Institute, the University of Michigan, University of Oxford, and many other collaborators as part of a worldwide scientific consortium with contributors from academia, industry, and non-profit organizations. <br> \
  We welcome the involvement of interested researchers. If you would like to contribute data or participate in analyses, please <a href='mailto:T2Dgenetics@gmail.com'>contact us</a>.
about.the.portal.data.text=The T2D Knowledge Portal enables browsing, searching, and analysis of human genetic information linked to type 2 diabetes and related traits, while protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the underlying data.
input.searchTerm.geneExample.help.header=gene names and aliases
input.searchTerm.geneExample.help.text=If your gene of interest does not appear in the dropdown, it may be listed in our knowledge base under an alias. Check <a target='blank' href='http://www.genecards.org'>GeneCards</a> and the <a target='blank' href='http://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/download'>HGNC website</a> for potential aliases.
input.searchTerm.variantExample.help.header=rsIDs
input.searchTerm.variantExample.help.text=Enter the reference SNP cluster ID (rsID) from <a target='blank' href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/index.html'>dbSNP</a>, or enter chromosome number, coordinate, common nucleotide, and variant nucleotide separated by underscores, for example 8_118184783_C_T.
input.searchTerm.rangeExample.help.header=chromosomal region
input.searchTerm.rangeExample.help.text=Searching by region may be a useful strategy if you are interested in a locus identified by a GWAS but have not narrowed down to a specific gene or variant. Simply enter the chromosome and start/stop positions that define that locus, in the format shown in this example.

insufficient.variant.data.help.text=We're sorry -- the portal's underlying knowledgebase does not have sufficient data to display this graphic. Some variants in our database are \
  multiallelic; others were not genotyped in our largest available sample set (an analysis of ~17,000 exomes). For these variants, we currently can display p-values but \
  not case/control counts. Please check back later to see if the data have been updated.

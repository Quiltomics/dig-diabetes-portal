sigmasite.data.summary=SIGMA researchers have built a worldwide resource that contains data from SIGMA projects alongside data from many other large genetic studies of type 2 diabetes. \
  Scientists can use these data to test hypotheses and investigate potential drug targets, as shown in this video:
sigmasite.about.content=The Carlos Slim Center for Health Research at the Broad Institute promotes wide access to genomic medicine in Mexico and Latin America. \
 It supports programs that focus on health problems that are relevant to the region and leverage its unique population genetics. It also works to enhance genomic research \
capacity in Mexico by training scientists and encouraging the development of genomic \
 diagnostics and therapeutics in Latin America. The Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas (SIGMA) \
  collaboration has discovered major new genetic risk factors for type diabetes, including variants in the gene SLC16A11 that are very common in Mexico \
  and a variant in the gene HNF1A that increases disease risk five-fold.

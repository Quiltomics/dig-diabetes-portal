  sigmasite.about.content=<p>In 2010, the <a href="http://www.carlosslim.com/responsabilidad_ing.html" class="sigma-link" target="_blank">Carlos Slim Foundation</a> through \
  the <a href="http://www.salud.carlosslim.org/english" class="sigma-link target="_blank">Carlos Slim Health Institute</a> and \
  <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/" class="sigma-link" target="_blank">the Broad Institute</a> came together to launch \
  the <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/programs/carlos-slim-center-health-research/carlos-slim-center-health" target="_blank" class="sigma-link">Carlos Slim Center for Health Research</a> \
  at the Broad Institute. \
  This unprecedented partnership aims to ensure that Latin Americans benefit from the genomic revolution by:<p>\
  <ul> \
  <li>promoting wider access to genomic medicine in Mexico and Latin America by supporting discovery programs that focus on health problems \
  with particular relevance to the region, and leverage its unique population genetics.\
  <li>enhancing genomic research capacity in Mexico through training of scientists and encouraging the development of genomic diagnostics \
  and therapeutics in Latin America. \
  </ul>\
  <br><p>That same year, with the contribution of $65 million from the Carlos Slim Foundation, the center launched the inaugural phase of the \
  Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas (SIGMA). In this 3-year phase, Broad scientists worked closely with Mexican colleagues \
  from 17 academic and research institutions led by the Mexican National Institute of Genomic Medicine, to systematically identify genes underlying cancer, \
  diabetes and kidney disease and to build capacity in Mexico in genomic medicine.</p> \
  <br><p>In 2013, in order to build on the project’s initial success, the Carlos Slim Center for Health Research launched the second phase \
  of the collaboration, known as SIGMA II, with an additional contribution of $74.1 million over three years from the Carlos Slim Foundation. \
  SIGMA II will leverage the genetic discoveries from the first phase of the project, with a focus on translating these discoveries into clinical impact. \
  One major research focus for SIGMA is type 2 diabetes (T2D), one of the most common diseases in Mexico, with an incidence higher than the global rate. \
  The SIGMA project set out to systematically identify the genetic risk factors that contribute to this disparity, and translate those findings into \
   improved methods of diabetes treatment and prevention. In the first phase of the project, SIGMA scientists sequenced and characterized more than 10,000 \
   tissue samples from Mexican and Mexican Americans. This unprecedented analysis led to the discovery of the first identified common genetic variant \
  shown to predispose Latin American populations to the disease. This finding provides unique biological insight into T2D and may present opportunities \
  for therapeutic research and development. Going forward, SIGMA is focused on completing the genetic analysis of T2D in Mexico, and translating this \
  knowledge into more effective new approaches to prevention and treatment.</p> \
  <br><p>The consortium has also built a worldwide resource that contains genetic data from SIGMA projects alongside data from other \
  genetic studies of type 2 diabetes. Scientists can use these data to test hypotheses and investigate potential drug targets.</p>

sigmasite.data.cohorts.header=SIGMA Cohorts
sigmasite.data.cohorts=<p>SIGMA's data includes whole exomes from 1,794 type 2 diabetes cases and 1,962 non-diabetic controls (3,756 total), \
 all of Mexican or Latin American descent. Genotyping data from a genome-wide association study is also available for all 3,756 \
 participants in the exome sequencing cohort, as well as 4,458 other research participants, also of Mexican or Latin American descent. \
 The GWAS dataset includes 3,848 type 2 diabetes cases and 4,366 non-diabetic controls (8,214 total). \

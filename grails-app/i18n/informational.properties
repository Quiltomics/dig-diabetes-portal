t2dgenes.mainPage.descr=T2D-GENES (Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples) \
is a large collaborative effort to find genetic variants that influence risk of type 2 diabetes.  With funding \
from <a class="boldlink" href="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx">NIDDK</a>, the group is pursuing three projects: (1) deep whole-exome sequencing in 10,000 people from five ethnicities (African-American, East Asian, South Asian, European, and Hispanic); (2) deep whole-genome sequencing of 600 individuals selected from extended Mexican American pedigrees; and (3) a trans-ethnic fine-mapping "mega-meta-analysis." Results from Project 1 are currently available on this portal. The T2D-GENES Consortium also funded and guided the construction of the portal.

informational.policies.data_use.header=POLICIES AND PLAN FOR DATA IN THE T2D KNOWLEDGE PORTAL
informational.policies.data_use.section_1=<p>\
The Broad Institute will serve as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for AMP-T2D. On behalf of AMP-T2D, the DCC will aggregate data, support analyses, and continue to update capabilities to disseminate results relevant to the genetics of T2D (T2D) and related traits, while coordinating collaboration within the AMP-T2D Project.\
</p>\
<p>\
Additionally, a key objective of the AMP T2D Project is to merge global data while maintaining compliance with regional data privacy regulations.\
Thus the FNIH aims to fund an organization(s) to build and maintain a federated node (or nodes) for the Knowledge Portal outside of the United States that\
will contribute data and query results to the Knowledge Portal while maintaining compliance with regional data privacy regulations. At least one node\
(that could potentially serve as a hub for other nodes) will preferably consist of a technical replicate of the Knowledge Portal currently being developed\
under other NIH/FNIH funded initiatives. This site(s) will also work in partnership with funding organizations and other funded parties such that proposed\
solutions comply with data harmonization methods, data processing methods, technical details, and data release policies being developed for the Knowledge Portal.\
</p>\
<p>\
The next set of sections of this document outline the Data Aggregation and Resource Distribution at the DCC. As the Federated nodes are funded, we will expand\
this document to include the processes for data aggregation at these sites. However, the policies and plan for Data Release and Use of Results outlined at the\
end of this document will apply to both data coming to the DCC and the Federated nodes.\
</p>\

informational.policies.data_agg.title=Data Aggregation and Resource Distribution at the DCC
informational.policies.data_agg.header=Data Aggregation
informational.policies.data_agg.section_1=<p>\
As the DCC for the AMP-T2D Consortium, the Broad Institute (along with its AMP funded partners) intends to (a) serve as the gateway to a large (and growing) aggregation of\
data relevant to the genetics of T2D and its complications; (b) automate analyses required to interpret those data; and (c) communicate results to diverse audiences via\
presentation and publication. Each of these goals involves distinct categories of resources and activities that we will share and/or manage:\
</p>
informational.policies.data_agg.section_2=<p>\
We will aggregate data on behalf of AMP-T2D. Data aggregated under this effort will not be generated by the knowledge Portal development work funded through the Portal-specific grants,\
but rather obtained from other investigators and repositories who wish to collaborate on and contribute to this effort, including other investigators funded by the wider AMP-T2D program.\
Moreover, the role of the Portal will not be to redistribute individual-level data, but rather to generate results attained via standard and customized queries that can be widely shared\
with the scientific community. Because the primary, individual-level data are neither generated by this project, nor redistributed to other users, the role of the Portal is limited to\
secure intake, storage and management, automated analyses, and dissemination of results in summary (i.e., not individual-level) form while complying with intended use of the data and all\
relevant regulations.\
</p>\
<p>\
We will focus on three classes of data: individual-level genotypes, individual-level phenotypes, and external precomputed results or annotations (e.g., results from individual\
studies or meta-analyses of multiple studies, processed annotations).\
</p>\
<p>\
The data and results currently stored in the Portal have either been generated at the Broad Institute as part of IRB-approved secondary use protocols or, in the case of\
meta-analysis results from published genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets, obtained in such a form that Broad was determined to be “not engaged in human subjects\
research” (per the criteria described in the U.S. Health and Human Services Office for Human Research Protections’ 2008 Guidance on Engagement of Institutions in Human\
Subjects Research, under criterion #7; see also http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/cdebiol.pdf). All data have been de-identified prior to being sent to Broad; at no time or\
under no circumstances will investigators funded by this grant have information linking data back to subject identifiers.\
</p>\
<p>\
For datasets subsequently added to the Portal, raw data will be obtained through formal NIH systems for data-sharing such as dbGaP, or directly from investigators who\
collected the data. It will be the decision of NIH and the AMP-T2D Steering Committee whether to accept into the Portal data that are not in dbGaP and, if so, the terms\
on which the data can be made accessible for analyses by other parties. At the DCC, we will develop software for storing and managing datasets, and will not redistribute\
the raw data to third parties. For bulk data (e.g., raw and harmonized individual-level genotype data), we will use object storage systems, with access controlled through\
application programming interfaces (APIs). Only authenticated and authorized users can access data; all such access is logged and auditable.\
</p>\
<p>\
The Portal will contain both publicly available datasets retrieved from public sources and data generated directly by investigators. In the case of datasets coming into\
the portal directly from publicly available databases (ie. dbGAP and EGA), the DCC will be tasked with aggregating the data and ensuring the necessary QCs are completed\
on the phenotype and genetic data before the data is available on the portal. Investigators submitting their data directly to the DCC will be responsible for ensuring\
that all incoming data is in the supplied in the appropriate formats.\
</p>\
<p>\
Additionally, we are currently building a database tool that captures data use restrictions for each dataset electronically using an ontology-based consent database, and\
can match those restrictions against potential research usage to ensure that only appropriate users can query specific datasets. Web-based tools, currently in development,\
support both the entry of data-use restrictions and the review of access requests.  This will enable the aggregation of additional and more diverse datasets for the Portal.\

informational.policies.data_transfer.section_1=<p>\
For all de-identified individual-level genetic and phenotypic data generated externally (genotype, phenotypes, annotations, etc.) received by the Broad Institute as DCC for the AMP-T2D\
Knowledge Portal, we will execute a Data Transfer Agreement (DTA) with the submitting institution. We will ensure that the usage of the data is compliant with the Data\
Use Restrictions associated with the dataset. It will be the responsibility of the submitting institution to outline the Data Use Restrictions for the data coming to the\
DCC for the Knowledge Portal.\
</p>\
<p>\
The data will never be shared with Portal users; only results will be shared. The individual-level and summary data will reside in one or several data vaults behind a secure\
firewall. User-activated analytical modules will be deployed behind the firewall to analyze the data or query precomputed results. The Portal will provide results in\
response to queries for information, obtained from genetic analyses performed on the data. The purpose of the AMP-T2D web Portal will be to enable broad access to the\
comprehensive results of genetic studies of T2D, related traits, and diabetic complications. To ensure that the web Portal is effective in allowing access to results and\
data –- both within AMP-T2D and with the broader biomedical research community –- we will develop an interface to provide access to results in a form designed to meet user\
needs while maintaining the individual data privacy requirements, and will engage Portal users in assessing the value of these features.\
</p>\
<p>\
Results from studies included in the Portal will be available genome-wide (i.e., not limited to "top hits"), and results from different studies and types will be integrated\
and presented simultaneously. Metadata and other technical details (e.g., analysis parameters, explanations of terms, documentation of methods) will be available at lower levels of drilldown.\

informational.policies.resource_sharing.section_1=<p>\
We will share software, methods, and code developed as part of consortium efforts. Specifically, we envision three types of sharing: (a) sharing of software source code;\
(b) sharing services; and (c) sharing of effort between groups with the intention of maintaining or extending existing software.\
</p>
informational.policies.resource_sharing.section_2=<p>\
We are producing open-source software under the terms of the BSD 3 open-source license (see <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause</a>).\
As such, this code will be\
freely available for use by any other parties; the software will be supplied “AS IS” with no implied warranty or promises of support. We will maintain a\
Github repository from which interested parties can download the source code.\
</p>
informational.policies.resource_sharing.section_3=<p>\
Our software will be constructed as a distributed system in which computers communicate using standard protocols (HTTP for transport, with REST as an organizing principle and data\
payloads defined with JSON), with well-defined interfaces specific to the computational topics addressed by each computer system. These services will in principle be accessible by\
any other party willing to adopt the conventions used by our services. To the extent that data on these services may be under privacy and use restrictions, these running services will\
be designed to provide information only in forms that protect privacy and security, or in secure, encrypted mode for other parties with permission to access and receive the information.\
</p>
informational.policies.resource_sharing.section_4=<p>\
The Portal architecture will be designed to facilitate front-end contributions (e.g., extensions of existing widgets for data exploration) from a wide community of developers.\
Data or computations for REST servers will be encapsulated as loosely coupled “plug-in” modules that may be written in different languages (e.g., Python, JVM-based languages,\
shell scripting). This approach anticipates the contribution of computational modules from other individuals and groups, both within and outside of the AMP consortium.\

informational.policies.data_release.process.header=Data processing and availability (applicable for both data coming to DCC and to Federated nodes)
informational.policies.data_release.process.section_1=<ol>\
<li><u>Data Deposit</u>: The DCC (and Federated nodes) will receive data from submitters on an ongoing basis. The Data\
deposition stage has several components that must be completed for the data to be ready for release into the Portal. These are: </li>\
<ol>\
<li>Data use agreements and ethical approvals for data transfer to DCC (or the Federated nodes) and release into Portal.</li>\
<li>Physical transfer of data and all meta-data, in required formats, into Data Intake System at the DCC (or at a Federated node).</li>\
<li>De-identified individual level genetic and phenotypic data generated externally</li>\
<li>Data storage, curation, QC, and harmonization of submitted data performed by the DCC.</li>\
</ol>\
<p>\
In general, upon depositing data into the Portal, a QC filter on genotypes and phenotypes will be deployed by the DCC as per standard operating procedures in the field. Data will only be available after these initial filters and project sanctioned analyses are applied. Filters will include automated steps and final human curation, as determined by the AMP-T2D investigative team.\
</p>\
<li><u>Early-Access Period</u>: After the Data Deposition steps are complete, data will be released to the Portal. This denotes the start of the Early\
Access Period.  This 6-month time period will be divided into 2 phases. The first 3 months will be the Early Access Phase 1 window where data\
are available on the portal to all users. At this point, project sanctioned QC and analyses have been performed, but the data are NOT considered\
final or fully integrated on the Portal. The goal of the Early Access Phase 1 time period is to allow users to review the data, to perform additional\
QC and analyses, and to finalize and integrate the dataset. At the end of the first 3 months, the data will move to the Early Access Phase 2, where\
data are considered final and fully integrated. During these last 3 month of Early Access Phase the AMP</li>\

informational.t2dsection.ashkenazi.header_1=T2D cases were selected from two separate DNA collections
informational.overview.project_1=<h3>Deep whole-exome sequencing in 10,000 people from five ethnicities</h3>\
<p>\
Project 1’s goal is to discover how variation in the protein-coding portion of the genome contributes to type 2 diabetes risk. The project’s dataset is unusually large and diverse, with exomes from 10,000 people across five ethnicities, including 1,000 type 2 diabetes cases and 1,000 controls from each:\
</p>\
<ul>\
<li>African-American (samples from Wake Forest University and the Jackson Heart Study)</li>\
<li>South Asian (UK LOLIPOP; Singapore)</li>\
<li>East Asian (Korea; Singapore)</li>\
<li>Hispanic (Starr County; San Antonio)</li>\
<li>European (Finns (METSIM); Ashkenazim)</li>\
</ul>\
<p>\
This diversity of ancestries allows scientists to find new genetic variants in populations that have otherwise been understudied. The project is also examining exomes to identify the transcripts most likely to be involved in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. In addition, T2D-GENES researchers are closely examining genomic locations that have been implicated in single-gene and syndromic forms of type 2 diabetes (such as MODY), evaluating them for association with traits that are related to the disease (such as fasting glucose levels). Ultimately, Project 1 is intended to answer major questions about the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes and how natural selection has shaped it, and to spur the development of new statistical and analytical methods that can be used in genomic studies of other diseases.\
</p>
informational.overview.project_2=<h3>Deep whole-genome sequencing of 600 individuals selected from extended Mexican American pedigrees</h3>\
<p>\
Project 2 aims to identify low-frequency and rare variants (those seen in less than five and less than .05 percent of the population, respectively) influencing type 2 diabetes risk. The project's dataset includes whole-genome sequence information on 1,043 people from 20 Mexican-American extended families in which type 2 diabetes is unusually common. The research participants were selected from two studies: the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) and the San Antonio Family Diabetes/Gallbladder Study (SAFDGS), collectively referred to as the San Antonio Mexican American Family Studies (SAMAFS). About 600 partipants have undergone high-quality whole-genome sequencing, with an average of 50x coverage. The remaining 440 participants have had genotypes imputed genome-wide based on their family members' information and data from the 1000 Genomes Project.\
</p>\
<p>\
Studies of large, complex pedigrees, such as Project 2, are especially well-suited for the study of rare variants. Finding rare variants in the population at large requires extremely large sample sizes; often, the variants may be seen only once, making it difficult to reliably determine their effects on phenotype. However, by studying large pedigrees, scientists can increase their chances of finding multiple individuals who carry the same rare variants (because those variants run in their families). Therefore, Project 2's approach provides a way to identify low-frequency and rare variants -- both at known GWAS signals and novel genomic loci -- that may contribute to type 2 diabetes risk.\
</p>
informational.overview.project_3=<h3>Trans-ethnic fine-mapping "mega-meta-analysis"</h3>\
<p>\
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated dozens of genomic regions in type 2 diabetes risk, but in many cases it is unclear which variants in those regions actually influence the underlying biology of disease, and which variants are merely near the disease-causing variants but do not themselves contribute to pathophysiology. The goal of Project 3 is to precisely identify the causal variants by (1) focusing on genomic regions previously implicated in type 2 diabetes risk; (2) inferring the existence of surrounding low-frequency variants by imputing relevant data from the 1000 Genomes Project; and (3) using a range of statistical approaches to determine which of these variants are most likely to cause disease.\
</p>\
<p>\
A "mega-meta-analysis," Project 3 involves data from 26,488 type 2 diabetes patients and 83,964 non-diabetic controls, with follow-up in 21,491 patients and 55,647 controls. The project is a collaboration between five consortia with research participants from different continental ancestry groups: AGEN-T2D (East Asians), DIAGRAM (Europeans), SAT2D (South Asians), MAT2D (Mexican Americans), and MEDIA (African Americans).\
</p>\
<p>\
This diversity of ancestries is especially important to the study design. Variants that are tightly correlated by location in some ancestry groups (e.g., Europeans) may travel more independently in other groups (e.g., African Americans). Therefore, examining data from many different groups can help distinguish between true causal variants and those that are merely along for the ride.\

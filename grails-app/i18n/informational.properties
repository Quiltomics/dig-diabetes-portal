t2dgenes.mainPage.descr=T2D-GENES (Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples) \
is a large collaborative effort to find genetic variants that influence risk of type 2 diabetes.  With funding \
from <a class="boldlink" href="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx">NIDDK</a>, the group has conducted \
two sequencing studies and one GWAS-based fine-mapping study in five ethnicities(African-American, East Asian, South \
Asian, European, and Hispanic). The T2D-GENES Consortium also funded and guided the construction of this portal.

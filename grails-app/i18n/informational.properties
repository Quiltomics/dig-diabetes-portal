t2dgenes.mainPage.descr=T2D-GENES (Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples) \
is a large collaborative effort to find genetic variants that influence risk of type 2 diabetes.  With funding \
from <a class="boldlink" href="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx">NIDDK</a>, the group has conducted \
two sequencing studies and one GWAS-based fine-mapping study in five ethnicities(African-American, East Asian, South \
Asian, European, and Hispanic). The T2D-GENES Consortium also funded and guided the construction of this portal.

got2d.title=GoT2D
got2d.cohort.descr= The GoT2D consortium aims to understand the allelic architecture of type 2 diabetes through whole-genome sequencing, high-density SNP genotyping, and imputation. The reference panel based on this work is intended as a comprehensive inventory of low-frequency variants in Europeans, including SNPs, small insertions and deletions, and structural variants. Data from the consortium?s exome chip study is currently available on this portal. Data from its whole genome sequencing study will be made available in the future.

                            Protein-truncating variants prematurely halt the translation of nucleic acids, resulting
                            in an abnormally short protein. If this protein cannot play its normal biological role, the
                            variant is considered a "loss-of-function" (LoF) variant. Large deletions of DNA, variants
                            that disrupt splice sites (thereby preventing introns from being removed from mRNA),
                            and frameshifts (insertions or deletions that render mRNA unable to read codons in the
                            proper sets of three) may also cause a loss of function. However, it is not always easy to
                            predict the effects of variants on protein structure, and the results of algorithms that do
                            so should be treated with care.

                            Specific LoF variants tend to be rare in the population at large. However, the average
                            individual carries about 100 LoF variants genome-wide. Some LoF variants cause
                            disease, others have no phenotypic effect, and still others are protective, such as LoF
                            variants in the gene <em>SLC30A8</em> that protect against diabetes. Protective LoF variants in
                        humans can serve as models for drugs intended to prevent disease by deactivating
                        targets.

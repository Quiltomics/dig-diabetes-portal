            Allele frequencies can vary widely by population, and some variants may influence disease risk in one population but not another.
            For instance, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24390345">a set of five variants</a>
            in the gene <em>SLC16A11</em> is common in people of Native American ancestry and increases T2D risk in that population;
        however, the variants are low-frequency or rare in other ancestry groups,
        and appear to play little to no role in T2D in Europeans.
        Thus, <em>SLC16A11</em> was not implicated in early GWAS of type 2 diabetes, which focused on people of European ancestry.

            Allele frequencies are derived from both exome sequencing and exome chip datasets.
            If a variant is in exome chip, its frequency from that study is used, since the sample size of exome chip studies is much larger.
            If a variant is in exome sequencing but not exome chip (as is the case with most rare variants), its frequency from exome chip.
            You can see whether a variant is from exome sequencing or exome chip from the <em>SIGMA source</em> column in the variant table.
        Finally, note that if a variant is not seen in either exome sequencing or exome chip data, it is assigned an allele frequency of 0.0.
        There is currently no way to identify whether a variant was genotyped and not seen, or was not in a part of the genome included in these studies.
